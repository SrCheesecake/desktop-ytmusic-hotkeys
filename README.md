Script I made using AutoHotkey V2 to make it more comfortable to use the youtube music desktop app. It skips, rewinds, pauses, increases/decreases volume or mutes your yt music, in the least interrupting way.
The YT Music Desktop app can be installed with the setup, and you can download AutoHotkey here: https://www.autohotkey.com/
You can check out the code, I personally used VS Code and the AHK++ extension by Mark Wiemer.

List of hotkeys:
| RCtrl + Right Arrow: Skip |
| RCtrl + Left Arrow: Rewind |
| RCtrl + Up Arrow: Increase volume by 5% |
| RCtrl + Down Arrow: Decrease volume by 5% |
| RCtrl + Numpad0: Mute |
| RCtrl + Numpad1: Like |
| RCtrl + Numpad2: Like and add to playlist |
| RCtrl + Spacebar: Pause |

Script I made using AutoHotkey V2 to make it more comfortable to use the youtube music desktop app. It skips, rewinds, pauses, increases/decreases volume or mutes your yt music, in the least interrupting way.
The YT Music Desktop app can be installed with the setup, and you can download AutoHotkey here: https://www.autohotkey.com/
